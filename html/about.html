<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  I'm a year 3 Computer Science undergraduate from HKUST. I share interest in web technologies, internet communication
  as well as cyber security. In addition to my interest of the programming-heavy areas of Computer Science, I also am
  heavily emgaged with the Human Computer Interaction theory. It teaches us how to present our ideas in a pleasing way.
  Compared to the forever shifting programming technologies, It is something that will never change or fade away.

  In addition to my education background, I also share over a year of experience working as a web developer. In my
  career, I primarily work on developing highly interactive web application with some of the most popular web
  technologies/frameworks in the market. Apart from development and deployment of different projects, I also share the
  experience on designing UI/UX of some applications. I am ready and eager to learn every aspect of web development.
