        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a year 3 Computer Science undergraduate from HKUST. I share interest in web technologies, internet
          communication as well as cyber security. In addition to my interest of the programming-heavy areas of Computer
          Science, I also am heavily emgaged with the Human Computer Interaction theory. It teaches us how to present
          our ideas in a pleasing way. Compared to the forever shifting programming technologies, It is something that
          will never change or fade away.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my education background, I also share over a year of experience working as a web developer. In
          my career, I primarily work on developing highly interactive web application with some of the most popular web
          technologies/frameworks in the market. Apart from development and deployment of different projects, I also
          share the experience on designing UI/UX of some applications. I am ready and eager to learn every aspect of
          web development.

        <h1>Project 1 - Smart Landry</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Smart Landry is a <u>mobile Application</u> which aim to assist UST student who stay on campus in doing
          landry. By providing functions including
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Machine availability browsing</li>
          <li>Notification upon landry completion</li>
          <li>Queueing system</li>
          <li>Laundry balance checking</li>
          <li>Custom item checklist</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The goal of this app is to enhance student's experience in using the landry facilities as well as to promote
          smart living ideology on our campus.
        </p>

        <h2>Brainstorming/Gathering User POV - why we come up with this idea?</h2>
        <p>At the beginning of our disscusion several problems on the campus were being addressed.</p>
        <p>
          First is the navigation problem. As campus is huge and the structure is complicated, it is often difficult to
          locate a room and sometime get lose before midterm/exams. Even there is exist solution to this problem, the
          Path Advisor, most people agree that it isn't really a effective solution to the navigation problem, as the
          direction indication could often could confusing in the app.
        </p>
        <p>

          <img src="./assets//mindmap-problem-nav.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Another campus problem that was being addressed is the queueing problem, as we also find that queueing in
          canteen or library is also a painful process that we often have to face.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Mindmap - Queing problems</i>
          <img src="./assets/mindmap-problems.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          The last campus problem, which is the one we develop our project from, is the landry room problem. From our
          interview and chat with our fellow UST students, many of us who stay or have stayed on the campus found that
          landry is a problem. Below some of the core problems of doing landry on campus.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, knowing when to pickup clothes is inconvenience. For now, there doesn't exist any system which connects
          the landry machines to the internet to let us know if our landry is finished. Therefore, student will have to
          setup their own timer or visit the landry room to check. However, student may sometimes forget to setup the
          timer and visiting the landry room is very time consuming, making pickup clothes difficult. Worse, the student
          may entirely forget to collection their clothes and occupy the washer unnecessarily, forcing other users to
          wait.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Picture from our storyboard</i>
          <img src="/assets//storyboard-forget.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, finding available machine is inconvenience. Since the only way know if there is any available
          washer/dryer is to visit landry, student may just waste a lot time to come and go between the landry room only
          to find no machine is available.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Survey conducted by one of our group member</i>
          <img src="/assets/whatsapp.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p>
          There also other problems regarding the landry room on campus. The mindmap below summarizes the complaints
          that we have garthered.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h2>Making Our Prototype</h2>
        <h3>Functionality</h3>
        <p>
          Targeting on the complaints that we have garthered, the below mindmap was made to list the functions of our
          app.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Mindmap - App features</i>
          <img src="./assets/mindmap-features.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          The main idea of our app is by link the landry machine to the network and using app as the interface to
          provide five major functions to enhance students' experience in using landry room.
        </p>
        <p>As listed in the introduction, we have designed five major function for this application</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Machine availability browsing</li>
          <li>Notification upon landry completion</li>
          <li>Queueing system</li>
          <li>Laundry balance checking</li>
          <li>Custom item checklist</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>UI/UX</h3>
        <p>For the UI of our app, there were two proposed layout.</p>
        <p>
          <i>Layout 1</i>
          <img src="/assets/ui-proposed.PNG" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Above is the first layout that was proposed. This layout display all of the information to the screen and
          provide a intuitive display for the user. However, this layout is also somewhat overwhelming for the user as
          too many information is displayed at once and it is difficult for the user to digest.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Layout 2</i>
          <img src="/assets/ui-proposed2.PNG" />
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the second layout that was proposed and the one we adopt. Referencing the layout of other app on the
          market, enough information can be displayed to screen without being overwhelming. This layout is also easily
          fit in small screen and easy for user to perform different operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>The final product</i>
          <img src="/assets/ui-final.PNG" />
        </p>
        <p>
          In the process of making our paper prototype, we used figma to draw our paper prototype as well as the
          simulation of the user flow. Below is the page we draw.
        </p>
        <img src="/assets/app-pages.png" height="800px" />
        <hr />

        <h2>Prototype Video</h2>
        <p>This video demonstrates the user flow and covers all features that we designed on our app.</p>
        <p>
          <video width="100%" controls>
            <source src="video/COMP4461_P1_Vid.mov" type="video/mp4" />
          </video>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Despite it is the first project in HCI course and my group have worked on it for only a week, I have already
          gain a lot and putting different HCI theories in practice while completing this project.
        </p>
        <p>
          My role in this project is to complete the paper prototype as well as the paper prototype video. Thus, I am
          heavily involved in UI/UX design process of this project. In this process, I have learned how to utilize
          different software tools such as Figma to construct the interface of our application and make simulation of
          the user flow of our software. Also, this process of designing the UI encourage me to explore different
          existing design on the app market, which broaden my horizons and lead to further think reasons behind the
          existing design.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be more specific, one thing that I have learn in terms of design thinking is how to utilize user's
          experience/knowledge on UI/UX in helping them to quickly adapt our UI/UX. By adopting popular UI/UX design on
          the market, the users can interact with our interface intuitively as they are likely to have seen/used the
          similar design before. Therefore, there is actually a good reason why we should copy the design elements from
          the others for improving user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, this project gave me the experience in designing a product at group zero to something with
          others. Although I do share experience in developing software with others from beginning stage to deployment,
          I was never involved in part which is about gathering the users' need and coming up with the functions. Hence,
          this experience will also help me in becoming a well-rounded software developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          All in all, this is fruitful project that helped me in not only in practicing the knowledge that I have learn
          in the lecture but also to explore by myself and learning something outside the syllabus.
