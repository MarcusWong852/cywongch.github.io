        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>
          I'm a year 3 Computer Science undergraduate from HKUST. I share interest in web technologies, internet
          communication as well as cyber security. In addition to my interest of the programming-heavy areas of Computer
          Science, I also am heavily emgaged with the Human Computer Interaction theory. It teaches us how to present
          our ideas in a pleasing way. Compared to the forever shifting programming technologies, It is something that
          will never change or fade away.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my education background, I also share over a year of experience working as a web developer. In
          my career, I primarily work on developing highly interactive web application with some of the most popular web
          technologies/frameworks in the market. Apart from development and deployment of different projects, I also
          share the experience on designing UI/UX of some applications. I am ready and eager to learn every aspect of
          web development.

        <h1>HCI Projects</h1>
        <h2>Project 1 - Smart Landry</h2>
        <h2>Project Description & Goal</h2>

        <!-- <p>
          Smart Landry is a <u>mobile Application</u> which aim to assist UST student who stay on campus in doing landry. By
          providing functions including 
          <ul>
            <li>machine availability browsing</li>
            <li>notification upon landry completion</li>
            <li>Queueing system</li>
            <li>laundry balance checking</li>
            <li>custom item checklist</li>
          </ul> 
          Student's landry experience could be enhanced as well as to promote <u>smart living ideology</u> on our campus.
        </p> -->

        <h2>Brainstorming - why we come up with this idea?</h2>
        <p>At the beginning of our disscusion several problems on the campus were being addressed.</p>
        <p>
          First is the navigation problem. As campus is huge and the structure is complicated, it is often difficult to
          locate a room and sometime get lose before midterm/exams. Even there is exist solution to this problem, the
          Path Advisor, most people agree that it isn't really a effective solution to the navigation problem, as the
          direction indication could often could confusing in the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          One solution that we have proposed is the use AR technology to help the student in directing to their desired
          destination.

        </p>
        <p>
          Another campus problem that was being addressed is the queueing problem, as we also find that queueing in
          canteen or library is also a painful process that we often have to face.
        </p>
        <p>The proposed solution is the enhanced vending machine.</p>

          <img src="./assets/mindmap-solution-queuing.png" />
        </p>
        The last campus problem, which is the one we develop our project from, is the landry room problem. Multiple

        <h2>Reflection/Achievements</h2>
        <p>
          Despite it is the first project in HCI course and my group have worked for only a week of time, I have already
          gain a lot and putting different HCI theories in practice when completing this projection. As my role in this
          project is to complete the paper prototype as well as the prototype video
